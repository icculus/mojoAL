/*
  The locking strategy for this OpenAL implementation is complicated.
  Not only do we generally want you to be able to call into OpenAL from any
  thread, we'll always have to compete with the SDL audio device thread.
  However, we don't want to just throw a big mutex around the whole thing,
  not only because can we safely touch two unrelated objects at the same
  time, but also because the mixer might make your simple state change call
  on the main thread block for several milliseconds if your luck runs out,
  killing your framerate. Here's the basic plan:

- Devices are expected to live for the entire life of your OpenAL experience,
  so deleting one while another thread is using it is your own fault. Don't
  do that.

- Creating or destroying a context will lock the SDL audio device, serializing
  these calls vs the mixer thread while we add/remove the context on the
  device's list. So don't do this in time-critical code.

- The current context is an atomic pointer, so even if there's a MakeCurrent
  while an operation is in progress, the operation will either get the new
  context or the previous context and set state on whichever. This should
  protect everything but context destruction, but if you are still calling
  into the AL while destroying the context, shame on you (even there, the
  first thing context destruction will do is make the context no-longer
  current, which means the race window is pretty small).

- Source and Buffer objects, once generated, aren't freed. If deleted, we
  atomically mark them as available for reuse, but the pointers never change
  or go away until the AL context (for sources) or device (for buffers) does.

- Since we have a maximum source count, to protect against apps that allocate
  sources in a loop until they fail, the source name array is static within
  the ALCcontext object, and thus doesn't need a lock for access. Buffer
  objects can be generated until we run out of memory, so that array needs to
  be dynamic and have a lock, though. When generating sources, we walk the
  static array and compare-and-swap the "allocated" field from 0 (available)
  to 2 (temporarily claimed), filling in the temporarily-claimed names in
  the array passed to alGenSources(). If we run out of sources, we walk back
  over this array, setting all the allocated fields back to zero for other
  threads to be able to claim, set the error state, and zero out the array.
  If we have enough sources, we walk the array and set the allocated fields
  to 1 (permanently claimed).

- Buffers are allocated in blocks of OPENAL_BUFFER_BLOCK_SIZE, each block
  linked-listed to the next, as allocated. These blocks are never deallocated
  as long as the device lives, so they don't need a lock to access (and adding
  a new block is an atomic pointer compare-and-swap). Allocating buffers uses
  the same compare-and-swap marking technique that allocating sources does,
  just in these buffer blocks instead of a static array. We don't (currently)
  keep a ALuint name index array of buffers, but instead walk the list of
  blocks, OPENAL_BUFFER_BLOCK_SIZE at a time, until we find our target block,
  and then index into that.

- Buffer data is owned by the AL, and it's illegal to delete a buffer or
  alBufferData() its contents while queued on a source with either AL_BUFFER
  or alSourceQueueBuffers(). We keep an atomic refcount for each buffer,
  and you can't change its state or delete it when its refcount is > 0, so
  there isn't a race with the mixer, and multiple racing calls into the API
  will generate an error and return immediately from all except the thread
  that managed to get the first reference count increment.

- Buffer queues are a hot mess. alSourceQueueBuffers will build a linked
  list of buffers, then atomically move this list into position for the
  mixer to obtain it. The mixer will process this list without the need
  to be atomic (as it owns it once it atomically claims it from from the
  just_queue field where alSourceQueueBuffers staged it). As buffers are
  processed, the mixer moves them atomically to a linked list that other
  threads can pick up for alSourceUnqueueBuffers. The problem with unqueueing
  is that multiple threads can compete. Unlike queueing, where we don't care
  which thread wins the race to queue, unqueueing _must_ return buffer names
  in the order they were mixed, according to the spec, which means we need a
  lock. But! we only need to serialize the alSourceUnqueueBuffers callers,
  not the mixer thread, and only long enough to obtain any newly-processed
  buffers from the mixer thread and unqueue items from the actual list.

- Capture just locks the SDL audio device for everything, since it's a very
  lightweight load and a much simplified API; good enough. The capture device
  thread is an almost-constant minimal load (1 or 2 memcpy's, depending on the
  ring buffer position), and the worst load on the API side (alcCaptureSamples)
  is the same deal, so this never takes long, and is good enough.

- Probably other things. These notes might get updates later.

       Naturally, we'll need to know the angle between where our listener
       is facing and where the source is to make that work...

       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_568VZWFJo

       ...but to do that, we need to rotate so we have the correct side of
       the listener, which isn't just a point in space, but has a definite
       direction it is facing. More or less, this is what gluLookAt deals
       with...
