/*
The locking strategy for this OpenAL implementation:

- The initial work on this implementation attempted to be completely
  lock free, and it lead to fragile, overly-clever, and complicated code.
  Attempt #2 is making more reasonable tradeoffs.

- All API entry points are protected by a global mutex, which means that
  calls into the API are serialized, but we expect this to not be a
  serious problem; most AL calls are likely to come from a single thread
  and uncontested mutexes generally aren't very expensive. This mutex
  is not shared with the mixer thread, so there is never a point where
  an innocent "fast" call into the AL will block because of the bad luck
  of a high mixing load and the wrong moment.

- As of the migration to SDL3, each OpenAL context is backed by an
  SDL_AudioStream bound to the audio device, so the "mixer lock" is no longer
  global lock that blocks all contexts during mixing, but rather blocks a
  single context at a time as it mixes. For most purposes, this doesn't
  change much, as most apps probably only have a single context. References
  to the "mixer thread" mean the thread that mixes all contexts, but each
  context is locked separately as this thread progresses.

- In rare cases we'll lock the mixer thread for a brief time; when a playing
  source is accessible to the mixer, it is flagged as such. The mixer locks
  each source separately as it mixes it (each source has an SDL_AudioStream
  and the mixer holds its lock), and if we need to touch a source
  that is flagged as accessible, we'll grab that lock to make sure there isn't
  a conflict. Not all source changes need to do this. The likelihood of
  hitting this case is extremely small, and the lock hold time is pretty
  short. Things that might do this, only on currently-playing sources:
  alDeleteSources, alSourceStop, alSourceRewind. alSourcePlay and
  alSourcePause never need to lock.

- Devices are expected to live for the entire life of your OpenAL
  experience, so closing one while another thread is using it is your own
  fault. Don't do that. Devices are allocated pointers, and the AL doesn't
  know if you've deleted it, making the pointer invalid. Device open and
  close are not meant to be "fast" calls.

- Generating an object (source, buffer, etc) might need to allocate
  memory, which can always take longer than you would expect. We allocate in
  blocks, so not every call will allocate more memory. Generating an object
  does not lock the mixer thread.

- Deleting a buffer does not lock the mixer thread (in-use buffers can
  not be deleted per API spec). Deleting a source will lock the mixer briefly
  if the source is still visible to the mixer. We don't believe this will be
  a serious issue in normal use cases. Deleted objects' memory is marked for
  reuse, but no memory is free'd by deleting sources or buffers until the
  context or device, respectively, are destroyed. A deleted source that's
  still visible to the mixer will not be available for reallocation until
  the mixer runs another iteration, where it will mark it as no longer
  visible. If you call alGenSources() during this time, a different source
  will be allocated.

- alBufferData needs to allocate memory to copy new audio data. Often,
  you can avoid doing these things in time-critical code. You can't set
  a buffer's data when it's attached to a source (either with AL_BUFFER
  or buffer queueing), so there's never a chance of contention with the
  mixer thread here.

- Buffers and sources are allocated in blocks of OPENAL_BUFFER_BLOCK_SIZE
  (or OPENAL_SOURCE_BLOCK_SIZE). These blocks are never deallocated as long
  as the device (for buffers) or context (for sources) lives, so they don't
  need a lock to access as the pointers are immutable once they're wired in.
  We don't keep a ALuint name index array, but rather an array of block
  pointers, which lets us find the right offset in the correct block without
  iteration. The mixer thread never references the blocks directly, as they
  get buffer and source pointers to objects within those blocks. Sources keep
  a pointer to their specifically-bound buffer, and the mixer keeps a list of
  pointers to playing sources. Since the API is serialized and the mixer
  doesn't touch them, we don't need to tapdance to add new blocks.

- Buffer data is owned by the AL, and it's illegal to delete a buffer or
  alBufferData() its contents while attached to a source with either
  AL_BUFFER or alSourceQueueBuffers(). We keep an atomic refcount for each
  buffer, and you can't change its state or delete it when its refcount is
  > 0, so there isn't a race with the mixer. Refcounts only change when
  changing a source's AL_BUFFER or altering its buffer queue, both of which
  are protected by the api lock. The mixer thread doesn't touch the
  refcount, as a buffer moving from AL_PENDING to AL_PROCESSED is still
  attached to a source.

- alSource(Stop|Pause|Rewind)v with > 1 source used will always lock the
  mixer thread to guarantee that all sources change in sync (!!! FIXME?).
  The non-v version of these functions do not lock the mixer thread.
  alSourcePlayv never locks the mixer thread (it atomically appends to a
  linked list of sources to be played, which the mixer will pick up all
  at once).

- alSourceQueueBuffers will build a linked list of buffers, then atomically
  move this list into position for the mixer to obtain it. The mixer will
  process this list without the need to be atomic (as it owns it once it
  atomically claims it from from the just_queued field where
  alSourceQueueBuffers staged it). As buffers are processed, the mixer moves
  them atomically to a linked list that other threads can pick up for
  alSourceUnqueueBuffers.

- Setting a source's offset (AL_SEC_OFFSET, AL_SAMPLE_OFFSET, AL_BYTE_OFFSET)
  will lock the source to adjust several things.

- Capture just locks the SDL audio device for everything, since it's a very
  lightweight load and a much simplified API; good enough. The capture device
  thread just dumps excessive audio from the audiostream if too much is
  queueing up, so this never takes long, and is good enough.

- Probably other things. These notes might get updates later.

        list against the original pointer. If the CAS succeeds, we have
        a complete list, atomically set. If it fails, try again with
        the new pointer we found, updating our next pointer again. If it
        failed, it's because the pointer became NULL when the mixer thread
        grabbed the existing list.

        The mixer does an atomiccasptr to grab the current list, swapping
        in a NULL. Once it has the list, it's safe to do what it likes
        with it, as nothing else owns the pointers in that list. */
